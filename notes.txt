-------------------
get mongo and cloudinary working

start with model
copy post model
create comment.js, paste post model
change post schema to comment schema

nred a comment that is a string
keep likes
yeet stuff we don't need

change user:{ 
to post:{ 
aka what post does this comment come from

that way we know where the comment belongs

change line 22 to "comment" and CommentSchema to export

now - we will see this in the post ejs..

go to the post controller
we need to add a line to load the comment model.
const Comment = require(".../models/comment")

there are going to be a lot of comments.

see getFeed - re-use that get posts line (one with sort)

so under getPost:...
add const comments = await Comment.find({post: req.params.id}).sort({createdAt: "desc" }).lean();
this finds all comments w/ post property of the post we are currently on.

look at the feed.ejs
look for the loop code,
yoink it for post.ejs 
change to i<comments.length
get rid of stuff until it's comments[i].comment
now the loop will pull off all the comments.

will also have to make a collection for database comments.


now - how do we get users to add comments?
need a form
take the form from the profile.ejs

change the code for add a comment.
change form action , take out the thing next to it.
change "title" instances to "comment"
remove the unnecessary divs

don't need the "upload" value

create a route for comments.
/comment/createComment on the same form.
but need the comment to go to the correct post.
plug in the post ID to the form. <%=post._id%>

in server.js
add the route
requrire the comment route

then make a comments.js file
copy the stuff from posts.js
change to commentsController
we only need a post route.
createComment/:id , commentsController.createComment 

create a comments controller
copy the stuff from the posts controller
delete the cloudinary stuff because we don't need it

under createComment 
change to req.body.comment
delete other stuff you don't need
add post: req.params.id
this is just like in the post controller in line 24

redirect back to the same post. "/post/"+req.params.id
