# Things to add (done)

- Create a `.env` file in config folder and add the following as `key = value`
  - PORT = 2121 (can be any port example: 3000)
  - DB_STRING = `your database URI`
  - CLOUD_NAME = `your cloudinary cloud name`
  - API_KEY = `your cloudinary api key`
  - API_SECRET = `your cloudinary api secret`

# "Homework"

- Add comments (not like in the code, comments functionality)
- Add user profile pages
- Make sure user can't like the same thing more than once
- Make this about ducks (naturally)
- Ideally fix the form validation so it doesn't delete everything when it doesn't like the PW, that's annoying as hell (May not be possible with Flash?)
- Fix file extension on upload being case-sensitive (done)
- (Nothing to do with this, but check if .lean() solves the Mongoose related problems I used a workaround for in the Wordle project)
