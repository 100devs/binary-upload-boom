# Binary Upload Boom Social Media App
This project was forked to practice commenting lines of code and adding the ability for users to make comments on posts. To get the project running, the user will need to fork the code, open the terminal in their source-code editor, and follow these steps:

# Install

`npm install`

---

# Things to add

- Create a `.env` file in config folder and add the following as `key = value`
  - PORT = 2121 (can be any port example: 3000)
  - DB_STRING = `your database URI`
  - CLOUD_NAME = `your cloudinary cloud name`
  - API_KEY = `your cloudinary api key`
  - API_SECRET = `your cloudinary api secret`

---

# Run

`npm start`

---

## How It's Made

**Tech used:** Embedded JavaScript (EJS), CSS, MongoDB for storage, Cloudinary for image storage and urls

My learning is focused on commenting code, removing the extra todos.ejs, adding the ability for users to submit comments for each post, and updating the README with clear instructions for the user. 

## Optimizations
I would refactor the existing code to improve the overall functionality of the application and improve the project's styling so that it is more accessible and appealing for the user.  

## Lessons Learned
I learned more about adding another feature to an already existing codebase and navigating the pathway throughout the different aspects of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture to ensure that it is functioning properly for a logged in user.
