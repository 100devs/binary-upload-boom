# Binary Upload Boom
This is a social media app created with 100devs team members. This repo is for fellow members (July catch-up crew: I'm looking at you!) to practice collaboration & contributing to open source projects. Let's use the post & profile features to show off projects we are making, and we can work on enhancing and adding features along the way. 

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** JavaScript, EJS, Express, MongoDB, Nodemon, Passport, Validator, Bcrypt, Cloudinary

In class, we mapped out models, routers, controllers--all the logic for the MVC structure. As an assignment, we were tasked with adding comments on posts. But why stop there? I've added some issues that we can start with for improvement. Feel free to add ideas and suggestions as issues as well!
