# Partials

"partials" refer to reusable components or templates that can be included in multiple web pages to maintain consistency and make code more modular. Partials are particularly common in server-side rendering (SSR) frameworks and templating engines like EJS, Handlebars, or Pug.

Here's how partials work and why they are useful:

    Reusability: Partials allow you to define a piece of HTML code (or template) that represents a specific component or section of a web page, such as a header, footer, navigation menu, or sidebar. Once defined, you can include this partial in multiple pages throughout your website.

    Maintainability: By separating your HTML code into smaller, reusable components (partials), you can make your codebase more maintainable. If you need to update a common element like the navigation menu, you can do so in one place (the partial), and the change will be reflected across all pages that include that partial.

    Modularity: Partials promote modularity in your code. Each partial represents a self-contained component with its own HTML structure and potentially associated JavaScript and CSS. This makes it easier to reason about and manage individual parts of your application.

    D.R.Y. Principle: D.R.Y. stands for "Don't Repeat Yourself," which is a fundamental programming principle. Partials help you avoid duplicating code by reusing common components, which reduces redundancy and makes your code more efficient.

    Cleaner Code: Using partials can result in cleaner, more organized code because it encourages separation of concerns. You can have separate partials for layout, headers, footers, and specific sections of a page, making your code easier to read and maintain.


### What is inside on the Views folder?

In web development, the "views" folder is a common directory where you typically store templates or view files that define the presentation layer of your web application. These templates are often used to generate HTML pages that are sent to the client's web browser. The structure and content of the views folder depend on the web framework or templating engine you are using.

Here's what the views folder is typically used for:

    HTML Templates: The views folder contains HTML templates or view files that define the structure and layout of web pages. These templates can include placeholders or dynamic tags that are filled in with data from your application's backend when a page is rendered.

    Dynamic Content: Views are used to display dynamic content based on the data and logic of your application. For example, you might have a view for displaying a user's profile, a view for a product page, or a view for a blog post.

    Templating Engines: If you're using a templating engine like EJS, Pug (formerly known as Jade), Handlebars, or Jinja, the views folder is where you store the template files with the engine-specific syntax. These engines allow you to embed dynamic content and logic within your HTML templates.

    Layouts and Partials: The views folder may also contain layout templates and partials. Layout templates define the overall structure of your web pages, including headers, footers, and navigation menus. Partials are reusable components or sections of a page that can be included in multiple templates, promoting code reuse and maintainability.

    Client-Side Rendering: In single-page applications (SPAs) and client-side rendering (CSR) frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js, the views folder may contain template files or components used for rendering views on the client side. In these cases, views are often written using JavaScript and may be stored in a different directory structure.

Here's an example directory structure for a Node.js application using the Express.js web framework:

`the folder structure of views/`
- views
  - layouts
    - main.ejs
  - partials
    - header.ejs
    - footer.ejs
  - home.ejs
  - about.ejs
  - contact.ejs

In this example, the "views" folder contains layout templates ("main.ejs"), partials for the header and footer, and individual view templates for pages like "home," "about," and "contact." These templates are used by Express.js to render HTML pages and serve them to clients when requested.

The views folder is a crucial part of the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, where the "views" represent the presentation layer responsible for displaying data to users.


Here's a breakdown of what each component might contain:

    layouts (optional):

        This subdirectory contains layout templates. Layout templates define the overall structure of your web pages, including elements such as the HTML structure, header, footer, navigation menu, and placeholders for content. Layouts help maintain consistency across multiple pages.

        main.ejs: This is a common layout template that serves as the main structure for most of your web pages. It often includes the HTML structure, a common header, and footer, and placeholders for dynamic content.

    partials (optional):

        The "partials" subdirectory contains reusable components or partial templates that can be included in multiple view templates. These components can be used for headers, footers, navigation menus, or other sections that appear on multiple pages. Using partials promotes code reusability and simplifies maintenance.

        header.ejs: This partial might contain the HTML code for the website's header, including the logo, navigation menu, and any other elements that are consistent across pages.

        footer.ejs: This partial could contain the HTML code for the website's footer, including copyright information, links, or any other elements that appear at the bottom of each page.

    View Templates:

        These are individual view templates representing specific pages or views within your application.

        home.ejs: This view template defines the content for the home page of your application.

        about.ejs: This view template defines the content for the about page.

        contact.ejs: This view template defines the content for the contact page.

These view templates contain HTML markup and may also include dynamic placeholders or templating syntax provided by your chosen templating engine (e.g., EJS, Handlebars, Pug). The templating syntax allows you to inject dynamic data and logic into your HTML templates when rendering them on the server.

Overall, the "views" directory is where you organize and store templates that define how your web pages should look and what content they should display. The structure and content of this directory will vary based on your project's specific requirements and the templating engine or framework you are using.

#### The functionality of views 

    Presentation Layer:
        Views represent the presentation layer of your application. They are responsible for defining the structure and appearance of web pages that users see and interact with in their browsers.

    HTML Rendering:

        When a client (typically a web browser) sends a request to your server for a specific URL or route, the backend processes the request and decides which view should be rendered for that route.

        The backend retrieves any necessary data from databases or other sources and passes that data to the chosen view template.

        The view template, often written in HTML and including templating syntax, is then rendered with the provided data to generate an HTML response.

    Dynamic Content:

        Views allow the backend to display dynamic content based on user interactions, data retrieved from databases, or other factors.

        For example, an e-commerce website might use views to display product listings, user profiles, shopping carts, and order confirmation pages, with each view rendering data dynamically based on the current user's actions or retrieved data.

    User Interface (UI):

        Views define the user interface and layout of your web pages, including the arrangement of elements like forms, buttons, images, text, and navigation menus.

        The backend can dynamically adjust the UI presented to users by choosing different views or view components for different routes or scenarios.

    Consistency and Reusability:

        Views help maintain consistency across your application. Layout templates (often stored in a "layouts" directory) define the common structure of your pages, ensuring that headers, footers, and navigation menus are consistent.

        Partial templates (often stored in a "partials" directory) allow you to reuse components (e.g., headers, footers) across multiple views, reducing code duplication and making it easier to maintain a consistent design.

    Response Generation:

        After rendering a view with dynamic data, the backend sends the resulting HTML as part of the HTTP response to the client's web browser.

        The client's web browser then renders the HTML, applying styles (CSS), and executing any client-side JavaScript to make the page interactive.

    User Interaction:

        Views can contain forms, buttons, and links that users interact with. When a user interacts with these elements (e.g., submits a form), the browser sends requests to the backend, triggering server-side actions.

        The backend processes these requests, performs necessary operations (e.g., data validation, database updates), and may render different views or provide feedback to the user based on the results of these actions.
